<p>Given these dangers, there is a reaction that could be very beneficial: &gt;2NO(g) + 2CO(g) = N2(g) + 2CO2(g) (8.1)</p>
<p>If NO and CO reacted like this, then the nitric oxide in the exhaust would disappear, and take a substantial amount of poisonous carbon monoxide with it. Unfortunately, the reaction does not seem to happen. Why is this?</p>

<h2>7.2 Is the equilibrium position unfavourable?<a class="headerlink" href="#7.2-Is-the-equilibrium-position-unfavourable?" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first possibility is that the reaction system has been able to reach chemical equilibrium, but the equilibrium position is not favourable. How does this come about? If equilibrium has been reached, then the forward (left to right) and backward (right to left) reactions are occurring at equal rates. In such a case, we can emphasise the fact by writing the reaction with two opposed, half-headed arrows: &gt;2NO(g) + 2CO(g) <img alt="inlinefigure" src="_images/arrow_right.gif" /> N2(g) + 2CO2(g) (8.2)</p>
<p>This indicates that both the forward reaction: &gt;2NO(g) + 2CO(g) <img alt="inlinefigure" src="_images/arrow_right.gif" /> N2(g) + 2CO2(g) (8.3)</p>
<p>and the backward reaction: &gt;N2(g) + 2CO2(g) <img alt="inlinefigure" src="_images/arrow_right.gif" /> 2NO(g) + 2CO(g) (8.4)</p>

<h2>7.3 Is the rate of reaction very slow?<a class="headerlink" href="#7.3-Is-the-rate-of-reaction-very-slow?" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If the equilibrium position is very favourable, then the reason why Reaction 8.1 fails to occur at 525 °C must be that its rate is very slow. Usually, a reasonable response would be to increase the temperature yet further, but the structure and economy of the car gives us little scope to do this. The alternative is to use a <strong>catalyst</strong>, which leaves the equilibrium constant unchanged, while speeding the reaction up.</p>
<p>Let us look at the changes that take place in the internal energy as reactants change progressively into products. Figure 52 shows a simplified version. The internal energies of the reactants (2NO + 2CO) and products (N2 + 2CO2) are marked by two ‘platforms’. The platform for the products lies lower than that for the reactants. This shows that the internal energy change during the reaction is negative.</p>

<p>Between the reactants and products, the internal energy does not decrease gradually as the reaction progresses; instead, it rises initially, reaches a maximum, and then declines. The upper curve shows the situation in the absence of a catalyst. The internal energy of the reacting molecules must first increase by an amount marked ‘energy barrier’ in Figure.</p>

<!--Quote id=quo052--><blockquote>
<div><p>How might the reactants, NO and CO, acquire this extra energy?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>One possible source is the kinetic energy of other molecules. Lucky collisions may provide some NO and CO molecules with unusually high energies. If these high-energy molecules then chance to collide with each other, they might be able to surmount the energy barrier and react with each other. This also explains why an increase in temperature increases the rate of a reaction: a temperature rise increases the speed of the molecules, and the required increase in internal energy following collisions
then becomes more probable. But as we have seen, in this case the rate is not great even at 525 °C. The energy barrier must be high. The main reason is a property of nitric oxide. In Reaction 8.1, the nitrogen and oxygen atoms in NO must be separated at some point, but the bond that holds them together is very strong. A large input of energy is therefore needed to bring the separation about, so the energy barrier is high and the reaction is slow.</p>

<h3>Box 8: The three-way catalytic converter<a class="headerlink" href="#Box-8:-The-three-way-catalytic-converter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The solution to the high energy barrier for Reaction 8.1 is to involve a third party - a catalyst. A suitable material is the metal rhodium. When NO and CO molecules enter a catalytic converter, they become bound to rhodium surfaces. The binding of NO to rhodium weakens the bond between the N and O atoms, and the NO unit becomes more vulnerable to change. For example, it is believed that in some cases, the bond is so weakened that the N and O atoms separate completely, and move about on the
rhodium surface. Pairs of nitrogen atoms can then meet, combine and leave the surface as N2(g); oxygen atoms can meet and combine with CO molecules on the surface, leaving as CO2(g).</p>
<p>Obviously, this type of reaction pathway is very different from one that takes place entirely in the gas phase with no catalyst present. Most particularly, because the catalyst surface assists the breaking of the bond in the NO molecule, it has a lower energy barrier (see Figure 52) and is much faster. In a <em>three-way catalytic converter</em>, some 90 per cent of the nitric oxide in the exhaust stream is converted to nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Figure 53 shows an example. The catalyst actually
contains rhodium and platinum. The platinum catalyses the reactions of both carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons (from the petrol) with oxygen, giving carbon dioxide and steam. The converter is called ‘three way’ because it thereby removes all three main types of pollutant: nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons. Figure 54 provides you with further details.</p>

<p>Figure 54 The core of a typical three-way catalytic converter</p>
<p>The core of a typical three-way catalytic converter consists of a cylindrical grid of thin-walled channels of square cross-section, composed of a ceramic material made from oxides of magnesium, aluminium and silicon (Figure 54). The platinum-rhodium catalyst is dispersed over granules of solid aluminium oxide, Al2O3, which have been specially prepared with a high surface area. The catalyst-coated granules are mixed with water to form a slurry, and passed through the grid, which is then heated in
a furnace. The process leaves Al2O3, impregnated with catalyst particles, dispersed on the walls of the channels. In passing through the channels, exhaust pollutants traverse pores in the Al2O3 granules, encountering metal catalyst sites where reactions such as that shown in Equation 8.1 occur. Efficient conversion occurs only if the air-fuel ratio on entry to the converter is right. The ratio is controlled mainly by measuring the oxygen with a sensor and then making any necessary adjustments to
the air and fuel supply (NO<em>x</em> denotes oxides of nitrogen; HC denotes hydrocarbons)</p>

<h2>7.4 Equilibrium positions and rates of reaction in this course<a class="headerlink" href="#7.4-Equilibrium-positions-and-rates-of-reaction-in-this-course" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Section 7 showed that if a reaction is to occur at a particular temperature, two conditions must be fulfilled: its equilibrium constant must be sufficiently large, and its rate sufficiently great. We finish by pointing out how this crucial distinction between the equilibrium constant and the rate reveals itself in Figure 52. The figure shows two different pathways by which the reactants can change into the products, but both routes begin at the <em>same</em> reactant energy level, and finish at the
<em>same</em> product energy level. Regardless of reaction pathway, the energy difference between reactants and products is the same. It is an energy difference between reactants and products that determines the equilibrium constant of a reaction, and therefore the equilibrium position. The fact that both pathways have the same energy difference, and therefore the same equilibrium constant, shows that the equilibrium constant in a reaction is quite unaffected by <em>how</em> reactants change into products.
With equilibrium constants, the nature and energies of the initial and final states are everything; what happens in between is immaterial.</p>
<p>When we turn to reaction rates, this is not so. In Figure 52, both routes start with the same reactants, and end with the same products, but the intervening stages along each pathway are very different. Such sequences of intervening stages are called <strong>reaction mechanisms</strong>, and the mechanism in the presence of a catalyst delivers a smaller energy barrier and a faster rate than the one that pertains when the catalyst is absent. With rates of reaction, therefore, the mechanism is crucial.</p>

<h4>Question<a class="headerlink" href="#Question" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The combination of sulfur dioxide with oxygen, and the decomposition of steam into hydrogen and oxygen are both reactions of great potential practical value. These reactions, and their equilibrium constants at 427 °C (700 K) are as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="figure" src="_images/s205_2_ue005i.gif" /></p>
<p>Write down expressions for the equilibrium constants of the two reactions. When the two reactions are attempted at 700 K, neither seems to occur. Which of the two might be persuaded to occur at this temperature, and what form might your ‘persuasion’ take?</p>
<p>The equilibrium constant of the first reaction, <em>K</em>1, is given by</p>
<p><img alt="figure" src="_images/s205_2_ue005i.gif" /></p>
<p>That of the second,</p>
<p><img alt="figure" src="_images/s205_2_ue005i.gif" /></p>
<p>The data show that <em>K</em>2 is tiny: at equilibrium, the concentrations of the hydrogen and oxygen in the numerator (the top line of the fraction) are minute in comparison with the concentration of steam in the denominator (the bottom line of the fraction). So in a closed system at 700 K, significant amounts of hydrogen and oxygen will never be formed from steam.</p>
<p>By contrast, <em>K</em>1 is large, so the equilibrium position at 700 K lies well over to the right of the equation, and conversion of sulfur dioxide and oxygen to sulfur trioxide is favourable. The fact that the reaction does not occur must be due to a slow rate of reaction. We may therefore be able to obtain sulfur trioxide in this way if we can find a suitable catalyst to speed up the reaction. A suitable catalyst is divanadium pentoxide, V2O5, and at 700 K, this reaction is the key step in the
manufacture of sulfuric acid from sulfur, oxygen and water. Figure 52 shows a similar comparison between uncatalysed and catalysed progress of reaction plots that would reflect the sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide conversion.</p>
